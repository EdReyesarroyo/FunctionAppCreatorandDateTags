#This script is designed for use with Azure Functions after proper function and idenity configuration to 
#handle events from Azure Event Grid and to tag Azure resource groups automatically based on event data. 
#Script validated on MME 3/11/24 and only scoped to ID RGs and for the UCO and PT subscriptions acknowledging that it would only 
#solve (est.) 80% of #the resource ownership problem within the environemnt as whole as some resources are provissionined 
#programatically via #managed IDs/IaC. The function APP is located at the Creator_Name_and_Date_AutoTag_RG resource group
